In code we trust, in Rust we find,
A language sharp, yet kind.
With lifetimes, threads, and safety near,
In Rust, our code is clear.

No nulls to break our steady stride,
No segfaults lurk, no bugs to hide.
With traits and enums, patterns blend,
In Rust, the errors end.

From borrow checkers, wisdom flows,
A compiler's love, it shows.
In systems built to last and grow,
In Rust, the future's glow.
